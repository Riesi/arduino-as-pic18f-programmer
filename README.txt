This linux version uses the implementation of Borland's conio.h by Piotr Helka (piotr.helka@nd.e-wro.pl) made arround ncurses library, so you have to install it first. Try "sudo apt-get install libncurses5*" in debian distributions.

----------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO:

1. Compile with make (deps: ncurses)
2. Upload the sketch to the arduino
3. Connect the chip (pic18f2550) to the arduino
4. Run ./pic_programmer HEX_FILE

Thats it!
